Major Changes
¶
With the release of Manim v0.19.0, we’ve made lots of progress with making
Manim easier to install!
One of the biggest changes in this release is the replacement of the external
ffmpeg
dependency with the
pyav
library. This means that users no longer
have to install
ffmpeg
in order to use Manim - they can just
pip
install
manim
and it will work!
In light of this change, we also rewrote our
installation docs
to recommend using a new tool called
uv
to install Manim.
Note
Do not worry if you installed Manim with any previous methods, like homebrew, pip,
choco, or scoop. Those methods will still work, and are not deprecated. However,
the recommended way to install Manim is now with
uv
.

Highlights
¶
#3501
: Replaced external
ffmpeg
dependency with
pyav
This change removes the need to have
ffmpeg
available as a command line tool
when using Manim. While
pyav
technically also uses
ffmpeg
internally,
the maintainers of
pyav
distribute it in their binary wheels.
#3518
: Created a
HSV
color class, and added support for custom color spaces
This extends the color system of Manim and adds support to implement custom color spaces.
See the implementation of
HSV
for a practical example.
#3930
: Completely reworked the installation instructions
As a consequence of removing the need for the external
ffmpeg
dependency,
we have reworked and massively simplified the installation instructions. Given
that practically, user-written scenes are effectively small self-contained Python
projects, the new instructions strongly recommend using the
project and dependency management tool uv
to ensure
a consistent and reproducible environment.
#3967
: Added support for Python 3.13
This adds support for Python 3.13, which brings the range of currently supported
Python versions to 3.9 – 3.13.
#3966
:
VGroup
can now be initialized with
VMobject
iterables
Groups of Mobjects can now be created by passing an iterable to the
VGroup
constructors:
my_group
=
VGroup
(
Dot
()
for
_
in
range
(
10
))
Breaking changes
¶
#3797
: Replaced
Code.styles_list
with
Code.get_styles_list()
The
styles_list
attribute of the
Code
class has been replaced with
a class method
Code.get_styles_list()
. This method returns a list of all
available values for the
formatter_style
argument of
Code
.
#3884
: Renamed parameters and variables conflicting with builtin functions
To avoid having keyword arguments named after builtin functions, the following
two changes were made to user-facing functions:
ManimColor.from_hex(hex=...)
is now
ManimColor.from_hex(hex_str=...)
Scene.next_section(type=...)
is now
Scene.next_section(section_type=...)
#3922
: Removed
inner_radius
and
outer_radius
from
Sector
constructor
To construct a
Sector
, you now need to specify a
radius
(and an
angle
).
In particular,
AnnularSector
still accepts both
inner_radius
and
outer_radius
arguments.
#3964
: Allow
SurroundingRectangle
to accept multiple Mobjects
This changes the signature of
SurroundingRectangle
to accept
a sequence of Mobjects instead of a single Mobject. As a consequence, other
arguments that could be specified as positional ones before now need to be
specified as keyword arguments:
SurroundingRectangle
(
some_mobject
,
RED
,
0.3
)
# raises error now
SurroundingRectangle
(
some_mobject
,
color
=
RED
,
buff
=
0.3
)
# correct usage
#4115
: Completely rewrite the implementation of the
Code
mobject
This includes several breaking changes to the interface of the class to make it
more consistent. See the documentation of
Code
for a detailed description
of the new interface, and the description of the pull request
#4115
for
an overview of changes to the old keyword arguments.
