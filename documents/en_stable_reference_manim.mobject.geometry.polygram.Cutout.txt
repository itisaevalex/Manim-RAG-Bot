Cutout
¶
Qualified name:
manim.mobject.geometry.polygram.Cutout
class
Cutout
(
main_shape
,
*
mobjects
,
**
kwargs
)
[source]
¶
Bases:
VMobject
A shape with smaller cutouts.
Parameters
:
main_shape
(
VMobject
) – The primary shape from which cutouts are made.
mobjects
(
VMobject
) – The smaller shapes which are to be cut out of the
main_shape
.
kwargs
(
Any
) – Further keyword arguments that are passed to the constructor of
VMobject
.
Warning
Technically, this class behaves similar to a symmetric difference: if
parts of the
mobjects
are not located within the
main_shape
,
these parts will be added to the resulting
VMobject
.
