_assert_valid_submobjects
(
submobjects
)
[source]
¶
Check that all submobjects are actually instances of
Mobject
, and that none of them is
self
(a
Mobject
cannot contain itself).
This is an auxiliary function called when adding Mobjects to the
submobjects
list.
This function is intended to be overridden by subclasses such as
VMobject
, which should assert that only other VMobjects
may be added into it.
Parameters
:
submobjects
(
Iterable
[
VMobject
]
) – The list containing values to validate.
Returns
:
The Mobject itself.
Return type
:
Mobject
Raises
:
TypeError
– If any of the values in
submobjects
is not a
Mobject
.
ValueError
– If there was an attempt to add a
Mobject
as its own
 submobject.
_gen_subpaths_from_points
(
points
,
filter_func
)
[source]
¶
Given an array of points defining the bezier curves of the vmobject, return subpaths formed by these points.
Here, Two bezier curves form a path if at least two of their anchors are evaluated True by the relation defined by filter_func.
The algorithm every bezier tuple (anchors and handles) in
self.points
(by regrouping each n elements, where
n is the number of points per cubic curve)), and evaluate the relation between two anchors with filter_func.
NOTE : The filter_func takes an int n as parameter, and will evaluate the relation between points[n] and points[n - 1]. This should probably be changed so
the function takes two points as parameters.
Parameters
:
points
(
CubicBezierPath
) – points defining the bezier curve.
filter_func
(
Callable
[
[
int
]
,
bool
]
) – Filter-func defining the relation.

\(\alpha\)
. If
\(0 < |\alpha| < 1\)

it will grow. Furthermore,
if
\(\alpha < 0\)
, the mobject is also flipped.

scale_handle_to_anchor_distances
(
factor
)
[source]
¶
If the distance between a given handle point H and its associated
anchor point A is d, then it changes H to be a distances factor*d
away from A, but so that the line from A to H doesn’t change.
This is mostly useful in the context of applying a (differentiable)
function, to preserve tangency properties. One would pull all the
handles closer to their anchors, apply the function then push them out
again.
Parameters
:
factor
(
float
) – The factor used for scaling.
Returns
:
self
Return type
:
VMobject
set_anchors_and_handles
(
anchors1
,
handles1
,
handles2
,
anchors2
)
[source]
¶
Given two sets of anchors and handles, process them to set them as anchors
and handles of the VMobject.
anchors1[i], handles1[i], handles2[i] and anchors2[i] define the i-th bezier
curve of the vmobject. There are four hardcoded parameters and this is a
problem as it makes the number of points per cubic curve unchangeable from 4
(two anchors and two handles).
Returns
:
self
Return type
:
VMobject
Parameters
:
anchors1
(
Point3DLike_Array
)
handles1
