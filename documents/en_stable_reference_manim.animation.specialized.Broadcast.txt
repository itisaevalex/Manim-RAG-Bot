¶
Bases:
LaggedStart
Broadcast a mobject starting from an
initial_width
, up to the actual size of the mobject.
Parameters
:
mobject
– The mobject to be broadcast.
focal_point
(
Sequence
[
float
]
) – The center of the broadcast, by default ORIGIN.
n_mobs
(
int
) – The number of mobjects that emerge from the focal point, by default 5.
initial_opacity
(
float
) – The starting stroke opacity of the mobjects emitted from the broadcast, by default 1.
final_opacity
(
float
) – The final stroke opacity of the mobjects emitted from the broadcast, by default 0.
initial_width
(
float
) – The initial width of the mobjects, by default 0.0.
remover
(
bool
) – Whether the mobjects should be removed from the scene after the animation, by default True.
lag_ratio
(
float
) – The time between each iteration of the mobject, by default 0.2.
run_time
(
float
) – The total duration of the animation, by default 3.
kwargs
(
Any
) – Additional arguments to be passed to
LaggedStart
.
