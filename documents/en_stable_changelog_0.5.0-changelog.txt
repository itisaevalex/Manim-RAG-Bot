Highlights
¶
#1075
: Add OpenGL Renderer
Adds an OpenGLRenderer, OpenGLCamera, OpenGL-enabled Mobjects, and a
--use_opengl_renderer
flag. When this flag is passed, you can pass the
-p
flag to preview animations, the
-w
flag to generate video, and the
-q
flag to specify render quality. If you don’t pass either the
-p
or the
-w
flag, nothing will happen. Scenes rendered with the OpenGL renderer must
only
use OpenGL-enabled Mobjects.
Deprecated classes and functions
¶
#1124
: Deprecated
ShowCreation
in favor of
Create
Deprecated
ShowCreation
in favor of
Create
across the library with the exception of the
show_creation
boolean variable
vector_space_scene.py
Added a deprecation warning in the original
ShowCreation
class.
#1110
: Deprecated SmallDot + OpenGLSmallDot
SmallDot
isn’t necessary and a deprecation warning will be raised. This will be removed in a future release.
New features
¶
#1037
: Added new fade and transform animations (
TransformMatchingShapes
,
TransformMatchingTex
,
FadeTransform
) from 3b1b/manim
Added new Fade animation:
FadeOutToPoint
Added
FadeTransform
and
FadeTransformPieces
for transforming mobjects and submobjects with a fade
Added
TransformMatchingShapes
and
TransformMatchingTex
for transforming mobjects and tex that have matching parts
#1097
: Added 3D Mobject
Dot3D
#1074
: Added jupyter media_width option to the config
#1107
: Added
Unwrite
animation class to complement
Write
Added
Unwrite
which inherits from
Write
. It automatically reverses the animation of
Write
by passing the reversed rate function, but it also takes an additional boolean parameter
reverse
which, if
False
, renders the animation from left to right (assuming text oriented in the usual way), but if
True
, it renders right to left.
#1085
: Added
Angle
and
RightAngle
for intersecting lines
Angle
and
RightAngle
both take two lines as input. If they intersect, or share a common vertex, an angle is drawn between them. Users can customize the look of the angle and also use a dotted right angle.
Enhancements
¶
#1144
: Improved quality of GIFs
#1157
: Refresh triangulation on call to
apply_points_function()
Rotate called apply_points_function, which was previous not subclassed by OpenGLMobject - now it is. Then, the vertex normals can be updated too.
Additionally, the old_points matrix would change after rotating, making the old points / new points test irrelevant. This is addressed with a .copy call.
#1151
: Added parametric function support to
OpenGLSurface
#1139
: In-Code
config[“preview”]
Support
#1123
: Added caching, skipping, and user-specified background colors to the OpenGL renderer
OpenGL play logic has been improved to support caching and skipping with
-n
argument ( it is now similar to Cairo play logic). A random bug was fixed in OpenGLSurface and OpenGL background color can now be changed via
background_color
argument.
#1118
: Allow passing animation arguments with .animate syntax
Users will now be able to do things like
obj.animate(run_time=2).method(arg)
if they want to specify animation arguments for an individual
.animate
call, and can still not specify any arguments like
obj.animate.method(arg)
.
Passing animation arguments is only allowed directly after
.animate
is accessed, if passed elsewhere then a
ValueError
is raised.
#718
: Rotating the numbers in y axis
In Axes, the y axis will be rotated 90deg but the numbers are
also rotated and shouldn’t be. Fixes this issue.
#1070
: Raise FileNotFoundError when unable to locate the .cfg file specified via
--config_file
Raising the error will stop script execution and let the user know that there are problems with the
–config_file
location instead of reverting back to the default configuration.
Fixed bugs
¶
#1224
: Fixed
ShowIncreasingSubsets
,
ShowSubmobjectsOneByOne
, and
AddTextLetterByLetter
#1201
: Prevent crash on
embed()
for empty scenes
#1192
: Fixed issue when an animation is cached, manim can’t merge the partial movie files.
#1193
: Fixed using
Animation
without a child
Mobject
in
AnimationGroup
AnimationGroup
may now take
Animation
objects which do not have a child
Mobject
, such as
Wait
.
#1170
: Fixed minor SVG parsing bugs
#1159
: Added support for multiple transforms in the same SVG element
#1156
: Fixed
DrawBorderThenFill
to support OpenGL and improved type hints for some functions
Fixed a bug in
DrawBorderThenFill
that prevented
Write
animations from working with
OpenGLVMobjects
and slightly improved type hints for some animation functions to include
OpenGLVMobject
.
#1134
: Fixed the
-a
flag.
The
-a
/
--write-all
flag was broken. When used, it would cause Manim to crash just after beginning to render the second scene.
#1115
: Fixed bugs in
OpenGLMobject
and added
ApplyMethod
support
Fixed undefined variables and converted
Mobject
to
OpenGLMobject
. Also, fixed assert statement in
ApplyMethod
.
#1092
: Refactored coordinate_systems.py, fixed bugs, added
NumberPlane
test
The default behavior of
rotate()
is to rotate about the center of
Mobject
.
NumberLine
is symmetric about the point at the number 0 only when
|x_min|
==
|x_max|
. Ideally, the rotation should coincide with
the point at number 0 on the line.
Added a regression test and additionally fixed some bugs introduced in
#718
.
#1078
: Removed stray print statements from
__main__.py
Uses rich’s print traceback instead and fixes an issue in printing the version twice when
manim –version
is called.
#1086
: Fixed broken line spacing in
Text
The
line_spacing
kwarg was missing when creating
Text
Mobjects; this adds it.
#1083
: Corrected the shape of
Torus
Torus
draws a surface with an elliptical cross-section when
minor_radius
is different from 1. This PR ensures the cross-section is always a circle.
Documentation-related changes

#1101
: Added documentation to
Mobject
#1088
: Added new svg files to documentation and imports
In particular, SVGPathMobject, VMobjectFromPathstring, and the style_utils functions to manim’s namespace.
#1076
: Improve documentation for GraphScene
Updated
coords_to_point
and
point_to_coords
under
manim/scene/graph_scene.py
as the dosctring of each function confusingly described the opposite of what it is supposed to do.
Changes concerning the testing system
¶
#1160
: Enable CI testing for OpenGL
#1100
: Rewrote test cases to use sys.executable in the command instead of “python”
Tests would fail due to
capture()
not spawning a subshell in the correct environment, so when python was called, the test would be unable to find necessary packages.
#1079
: Removed the hardcoded value,
manim
, in
test_version.py
Changes to our development infrastructure
¶
#1213
: Updated TinyTex dependencies
#1187
: Add CodeCov to Github Workflow
#1166
: CI: Use poetry’s cache dir rather than pip
#1071
: Enable pytest-cov based code coverage
Include pytest-cov as a python module as part of developer dependencies
In updating poetry to include pytest-cov, manimpango moved from version 0.2.3 to 0.2.4, and libpango1.0-dev needed to be installed in Ubuntu.
Add to the CI workflow (
ci.yml
) to create and upload test coverage.
#1073
: Removed “one line summary” from PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
Code quality improvements and similar refactors
¶
#1167
: Merge
OpenGLMobject
and
Mobject
#1164
: Fixed single PEP8 style in
cairo_renderer.py
#1140
: Flake8 Compat & Code Cleanup
#1019
: Refactored
play()
Removed the _**three**_ decorators of
play()
, in particular: caching logic and file writer logic are now included within
play()
(it wasn’t possible before, because
scene.wait
and
scene.play
were two different things).
Added
is_static_wait
attributes to Wait. (<=> if wait is a frozen frame).
Renamed and moved
scene.add_static_frame
to
renderer.freeze_current_frame
.
Now when calling play without animation, it raises
ValueError
instead of just a warning.
Fixed
#874
by modifying
renderer.update_skipping_status
renderer
starts the animation with
scene.begin_animations
(
scene.compile_animation_data
used to do this)
The run time and the time progression generation is now done in
scene.play_internal
although it’d make more sense that renderer processes it later.
Added a bunch of cool tests thanks to mocks, and thanks to the new syntax
scene.render
