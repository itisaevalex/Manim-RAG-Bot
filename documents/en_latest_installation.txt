Installation
¶
Depending on your use case, different installation options are recommended:
if you just want to play around with Manim for a bit, interactive in-browser
notebooks are a really simple way of exploring the library as they
require no local installation. Head over to
https://try.manim.community
to give our interactive tutorial a try.
Otherwise, if you intend to use Manim to work on an animation project,
we recommend installing the library locally (preferably to some isolated
virtual Python environment, or a conda-like environment, or via Docker).
Warning
Note that there are several different versions of Manim. The
instructions on this website are
only
for the
community edition
.

differences between Manim
versions
if you are unsure which
version you should install.
(Recommended) Installing Manim via Python’s package manager pip
Installing Manim to a conda environment
Using Manim via Docker
Interactive Jupyter notebooks via Binder / Google Colab
Installing Manim locally via pip
¶
The recommended way of installing Manim is by using Python’s package manager
pip. If you already have a Python environment set up, you can simply run
pip
install
manim
to install the library.
Our
local installation guide
provides more detailed
instructions, including best practices for setting up a suitable local environment.
Installing Manim via Conda and related environment managers
¶
Conda is a package manager for Python that allows creating environments
where all your dependencies are stored. Like this, you don’t clutter up your PC with
unwanted libraries and you can just delete the environment when you don’t need it anymore.
It is a good way to install manim since all dependencies like
pycairo
, etc. come with it.
Also, the installation steps are the same, no matter if you are
on Windows, Linux, Intel Macs or on Apple Silicon.
Note
There are various popular alternatives to Conda like
mamba
/
micromamba
,
or
pixi
.
They all can be used to setup a suitable, isolated environment
for your Manim projects.

Working with Manim
Using Manim via Docker
¶
Docker
is a virtualization tool that
allows the distribution of encapsulated software environments (containers).
The following pages contain more information about the docker image
maintained by the community,

Basic usage of the Docker container
Running JupyterLab via Docker
Interactive Jupyter notebooks for your browser
¶
Manim ships with a built-in
%%manim
IPython magic command
designed for the use within
Jupyter notebooks
.
Our interactive tutorial over at
https://try.manim.community
illustrates
how Manim can be used from within a Jupyter notebook.
The following pages explain how you can setup interactive environments
like that yourself:
Jupyter Notebooks
Binder
Google Colaboratory
Editors
¶
If you’re using Visual Studio Code you can install an extension called
Manim Sideview
which provides automated rendering and an integrated preview
of the animation inside the editor. The extension can be installed through the
marketplace of VS Code
.
Caution
This extension is not officially maintained by the Manim Community.
If you run into issues, please report them to the extension’s author.
Installation for developers
¶
In order to change code in the library, it is recommended to
install Manim in a different way. Please follow the instructions
in our
contribution guide
if you are
interested in that.
