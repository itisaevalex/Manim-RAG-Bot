Breaking changes
¶
#1843
: Dropped redundant OpenGL files and add metaclass support for
Surface
OpenGL<x>
classes from
opengl_geometry.py
,
opengl_text_mobject.py
,
opengl_tex_mobject.py
,
opengl_svg_path.py
,
opengl_svg_mobject.py
and most of
opengl_three_dimensions.py
have been removed.
ParametricSurface
has been renamed to
Surface
Deprecated classes and functions
¶
#1941
: Added examples, tests and improved documentation for
coordinate_systems
#1694
: Added
font_size
parameter for
Tex
and
Text
, replaced
scale
parameters with
font_size
#1860

New features
¶
#1929
: Implementing a
zoom
parameter for
ThreeDScene.move_camera()
Zooming into a
ThreeDScene
can now be done by calling, for example,
self.move_camera(zoom=2)
in the
construct
method.
#1980
: Added a
dissipating_time
keyword argument to
TracedPath
to allow animating a dissipating path
#1899
: Allow switching the renderer to OpenGL at runtime
Previously, the metaclass approach only changed the inheritance chain to switch between OpenGL and cairo mobjects when the class objects are initialized, i.e., at import time. This PR also triggers the changes to the inheritance chain when the value of
config.renderer
is changed.
#1828
: Added configuration option
zero_pad
for zero padding PNG file names

#1841
: Reduced default resolution of
Dot3D
#1866
: Allow passing keyword argument
corner_radius
to
SurroundingRectangle
#1847
