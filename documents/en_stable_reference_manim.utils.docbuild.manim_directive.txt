manim_directive
¶
A directive for including Manim videos in a Sphinx document
¶
When rendering the HTML documentation, the
..
manim::
directive
implemented here allows to include rendered videos.
Its basic usage that allows processing
inline content
looks as follows:
..
manim
::
MyScene
class
MyScene
(
Scene
):
def
construct
(
self
):
...
It is required to pass the name of the class representing the
scene to be rendered to the directive.
As a second application, the directive can also be used to
render scenes that are defined within doctests, for example:
..
manim
::
DirectiveDoctestExample
:
ref_classes
:
Dot
>>>
from
manim
import
Create
,
Dot
,
RED
,
Scene
>>>
dot
=
Dot
(
color
=
RED
)
>>>
dot
.
color
ManimColor
(
'#FC6255'
)
>>>
class
DirectiveDoctestExample
(
Scene
):
...
def
construct
(
self
):
...
self
.
play
(
Create
(
dot
))
Options
¶
Options can be passed as follows:
..
manim
::
<

:
<

The following configuration options are supported by the
directive:
hide_source
If this flag is present without argument,
the source code is not displayed above the rendered video.
no_autoplay
If this flag is present without argument,
the video will not autoplay.
quality
{‘low’, ‘medium’, ‘high’, ‘fourk’}
Controls render quality of the video, in analogy to
the corresponding command line flags.
save_as_gif
If this flag is present without argument,
the scene is rendered as a gif.
save_last_frame
If this flag is present without argument,
an image representing the last frame of the scene will
be rendered and displayed, instead of a video.
ref_classes
A list of classes, separated by spaces, that is
rendered in a reference block after the source code.
ref_functions
A list of functions, separated by spaces,
that is rendered in a reference block after the source code.
ref_methods
A list of methods, separated by spaces,
that is rendered in a reference block after the source code.
Classes

The manim directive, rendering videos while building the documentation.
