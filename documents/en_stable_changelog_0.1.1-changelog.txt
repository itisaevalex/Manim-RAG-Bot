v0.1.1
¶
Date
:
December 1, 2020
Changes since Manim Community release v0.1.0
Plugins
¶
Provided a standardized method for plugin discoverability, creation,
installation, and usage. See the
documentation
.
Fixes
¶
JsRender is optional to install. (via
#697
).
Allow importing modules from the same directory as the input
file when using
manim
from the command line (via
#724
).
Remove some unnecessary or unpythonic methods from
Scene
(
get_mobjects
,
add_mobjects_among
,
get_mobject_copies
),
via
#758
.
Fix formatting of
Code
(via
#798
).
Configuration
¶
Removed the
skip_animations
config option and added the
Renderer.skip_animations
attribute instead (via
#696
).
The global
config
dict has been replaced by a global
config
instance
of the new class
ManimConfig
. This class has a dict-like API, so
this should not break user code, only make it more robust. See the
Configuration tutorial for details.
Added the option to configure a directory for external assets (via
#649
).
Documentation
¶
Add
:issue:
and
:pr:
directives for simplifying linking to issues and
pull requests on GitHub (via
#685
).
Add a
skip-manim
tag for skipping the
..
manim::
directive when
building the documentation locally (via
#796
).
Mobjects, Scenes, and Animations
¶
The
alignment
attribute to Tex and MathTex has been removed in favour of
tex_environment
.
Text
now uses Pango for rendering.
PangoText
has been removed. The old implementation is still available as a fallback as
CairoText
.
Variations of
Dot
have been added as
AnnotationDot
(a bigger dot with bolder stroke) and
LabeledDot
(a dot containing a
label).
Scene.set_variables_as_attrs has been removed (via
#692
).
Ensure that the axes for graphs (
GraphScene
) always intersect (
#580
).
Now Mobject.add_updater does not call the newly-added updater by default
(use
call_updater=True
instead) (via
#710
)
VMobject now has methods to determine and change the direction of the points (via
#647
).
Added BraceBetweenPoints (via
#693
).
Added ArcPolygon and ArcPolygonFromArcs (via
#707
).
Added Cutout (via
#760
).
Added Mobject raise not implemented errors for dunder methods and implementations for VGroup dunder methods (via
#790
).
Added
ManimBanner
for a animated version of our logo and banner (via
#729
)
The background color of a scene can now be changed reliably by setting, e.g.,
self.camera.background_color
=
RED
(via
#716
).
