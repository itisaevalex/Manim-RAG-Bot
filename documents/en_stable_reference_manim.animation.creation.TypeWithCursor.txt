Parameters
:
time_per_char
(
float
) – Frequency of appearance of the letters.
cursor
(
Mobject
) –
Mobject
shown after the last added letter.
buff
(
float
) – Controls how far away the cursor is to the right of the last added letter.
keep_cursor_y
(
bool
) – If
True
, the cursor’s y-coordinate is set to the center of the
Text
and remains the same throughout the animation. Otherwise, it is set to the center of the last added letter.
leave_cursor_on
(
bool
) – Whether to show the cursor after the animation.
