Custom type definitions used in Manim.
Note for developers
Around the source code there are multiple strings which look like this:
'''
[CATEGORY]
<category_name>
'''
All type aliases defined under those strings will be automatically
classified under that category.
If you need to define a new category, respect the format described above.
