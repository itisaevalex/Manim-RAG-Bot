Succession

Qualified name:
manim.animation.composition.Succession
class
Succession
(

,
use_override

[source]
¶
Bases:
AnimationGroup
Plays a series of animations in succession.
Parameters
:
animations
(
Animation
) – Sequence of
Animation
objects to be played.
lag_ratio
(
float
) –
Defines the delay after which the animation is applied to submobjects. A lag_ratio of
n.nn
means the next animation will play when
nnn%
of the current animation has played.
Defaults to 1.0, meaning that the next animation will begin when 100% of the current
animation has played.
This does not influence the total runtime of the animation. Instead the runtime
of individual animations is adjusted so that the complete animation has the defined
run time.

Methods
begin
Begin the animation.
finish
Finish the animation.
interpolate
Set the animation progress.
next_animation
Proceeds to the next animation.
update_active_animation
update_mobjects
Updates things like starting_mobject, and (for Transforms) target_mobject.

kwargs

¶
Initialize self. See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
Parameters
:
animations
(
Animation
)
lag_ratio
(
float
)
Return type
:
None
_setup_scene
(
scene
)
[source]
¶
Setup up the
Scene
before starting the animation.
This includes to
add()
the Animation’s
Mobject
if the animation is an introducer.
Parameters
:
scene
– The scene the animation should be cleaned up from.
Return type
:
None
begin
(
)
[source]
¶
Begin the animation.
This method is called right as an animation is being played. As much
initialization as possible, especially any mobject copying, should live in this
method.
Return type
:
None
finish
(
)
[source]
¶
Finish the animation.
This method gets called when the animation is over.
Return type
:
None
interpolate
(
alpha
)
[source]
¶
Set the animation progress.
This method gets called for every frame during an animation.
Parameters
:
alpha
(
float
) – The relative time to set the animation to, 0 meaning the start, 1 meaning
the end.
Return type
:
None
next_animation
(
)
[source]
¶
Proceeds to the next animation.
This method is called right when the active animation finishes.
Return type
:
None
update_mobjects
(
dt
)
[source]
¶
Updates things like starting_mobject, and (for
Transforms) target_mobject. Note, since typically
(always?) self.mobject will have its updating
suspended during the animation, this will do
nothing to self.mobject.
Parameters
:
dt
(
float
)
Return type
:
None
