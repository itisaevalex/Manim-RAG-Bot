Utilities for working with mobjects.
Functions
get_mobject_class
(
)
[source]
¶
Gets the base mobject class, depending on the currently active renderer.
Note
This method is intended to be used in the code base of Manim itself
or in plugins where code should work independent of the selected
renderer.
Examples
The function has to be explicitly imported. We test that
the name of the returned class is one of the known mobject
base classes:
>>>
from
manim.mobject.utils
import
get_mobject_class
>>>
get_mobject_class
()
.
__name__
in
[
'Mobject'
,
'OpenGLMobject'
]
True
Return type
:
type
get_point_mobject_class
(

¶
Gets the point cloud mobject class, depending on the currently
active renderer.
