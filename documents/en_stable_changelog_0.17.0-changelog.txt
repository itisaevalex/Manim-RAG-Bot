Breaking changes
¶
#2898
: Ported improved implementation of
SVGMobject
from 3b1b/manim
The implementation of
SVGMobject
is completely changed in this release.
Manim now uses the Python library
svgelements
to parse SVGs, instead of trying
to do it itself. The former class for SVG path objects,
SVGPathMobject
has been
replaced (without deprecation) with
VMobjectFromSVGPath
.
If you need to create a mobject from an SVG path string, you can do so via:
import
svgelements
as
se
my_path_mobject
=
VMobjectFromSVGPath
(
se
.
Path
(
my_path_string
))
The unused class
TexSymbol
has been removed. The modules
manim.mobject.svg.svg_path
and
manim.mobject.svg.style_utils
became
superfluous due to the rework and have been removed.
#3030
: Added support for Python 3.11, dropped support for Python 3.7
Highlights
¶
#3049
: Added thematic guide for the
manim-voiceover
plugin
This new
thematic guide
provides a brief
introduction to
manim-voiceover
, a plugin that helps to add voiceovers
to your manimations. Supports both working with your own voice as well as
synthetically generated voices.

#3014
: Enabled code completion for

to improve code completion.
