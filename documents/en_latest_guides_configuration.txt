Configuration
¶
Manim provides an extensive configuration system that allows it to adapt to
many different use cases. There are many configuration options that can be
configured at different times during the scene rendering process. Each option
can be configured programmatically via
the ManimConfig class
, at the time
of command invocation via
command-line arguments
, or at the time the library
is first imported via
the config files
.
The most common, simplest, and recommended way to configure Manim is
via the command-line interface (CLI), which is described directly below.
Command-line arguments
¶
By far the most commonly used command in the CLI is the
render
command,
which is used to render scene(s) to an output file.
It is used with the following arguments:
/home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/manimce/envs/latest/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydub/utils.py:170: RuntimeWarning: Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work
 warn("Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work", RuntimeWarning)
Manim Community v0.19.0

Usage: manim render [OPTIONS] FILE [SCENE_NAMES]...

 Render SCENE(S) from the input FILE.

 FILE is the file path of the script or a config file.
...
However, since Manim defaults to the
render
command whenever no command
is specified, the following form is far more common and can be used instead:
manim
[
OPTIONS
]
FILE
[
SCENES
]
An example of using the above form is:
manim
-qm
file.py
SceneOne
This asks Manim to search for a Scene class called
SceneOne
inside the
file
file.py
and render it with medium quality (specified by the
-qm
flag).
Another frequently used flag is
-p
(“preview”), which makes manim
open the rendered video after it’s done rendering.
Note
The
-p
flag does not change any properties of the global
config
dict. The
-p
flag is only a command-line convenience.
Advanced examples
¶
To render a scene in high quality, but only output the last frame of the scene
instead of the whole video, you can execute
manim
-sqh
<file.py>
SceneName
The following example specifies the output file name (with the
-o
flag), renders only the first ten animations (
-n
flag) with a white
background (
-c
flag), and saves the animation as a
.gif
instead of as a
.mp4
file (
--format=gif
flag). It uses the default quality and does not try to
open the file after it is rendered.
manim
-o
myscene
--format
=
gif
-n
0
,10
-c
WHITE
<file.py>
SceneName

The ManimConfig class
¶
The most direct way of configuring Manim is through the global
config
object,
which is an instance of
ManimConfig
. Each property of this class is
a config option that can be accessed either with standard attribute syntax or
with dict-like syntax:
>>>
from
manim
import
*
>>>
config
.
background_color
=
WHITE
>>>
config
[
"background_color"
]
=
WHITE
Note
The former is preferred; the latter is provided for backwards
compatibility.
Most classes, including
Camera
,
Mobject
, and
Animation
, read some of their default configuration from the global
config
.
>>>
Camera
({})
.
background_color
<Color white>
>>>
config
.
background_color
=
RED
# 0xfc6255
>>>
Camera
({})
.
background_color
<Color #fc6255>
ManimConfig
is designed to keep internal consistency. For example,
setting
frame_y_radius
will affect
frame_height
:
>>>
config
.
frame_height
8.0
>>>
config
.
frame_y_radius
=
5.0
>>>
config
.
frame_height
10.0
The global
config
object is meant to be the single source of truth for all
config options. All of the other ways of setting config options ultimately
change the values of the global
config
object.
The following example illustrates the video resolution chosen for examples
rendered in our documentation with a reference frame.
Example: ShowScreenResolution
¶
from
manim
import
*
class
ShowScreenResolution
(
Scene
):
def
construct
(
self
):
pixel_height
=
config
[
"pixel_height"
]
# 1080 is default
pixel_width
=
config
[
"pixel_width"
]
# 1920 is default
frame_width
=
config
[
"frame_width"
]

]

 def construct(self):
 pixel_height = config["pixel_height"] # 1080 is default
 pixel_width = config["pixel_width"] # 1920 is default
 frame_width = config["frame_width"]
 frame_height = config["frame_height"]
 self.add(Dot())
 d1 = Line(frame_width * LEFT / 2, frame_width * RIGHT / 2).to_edge(DOWN)
 self.add(d1)
 self.add(Text(str(pixel_width)).next_to(d1, UP))
 d2 = Line(frame_height * UP / 2, frame_height * DOWN / 2).to_edge(LEFT)
 self.add(d2)
 self.add(Text(str(pixel_height)).next_to(d2, RIGHT))
The config files
¶
As the last example shows, executing Manim from the command line may involve
using many flags simultaneously. This may become a nuisance if you must
execute the same script many times in a short time period, for example, when
making small incremental tweaks to your scene script. For this reason, Manim
can also be configured using a configuration file. A configuration file is a
file ending with the suffix
.cfg
.
To use a local configuration file when rendering your scene, you must create a
file with the name
manim.cfg
in the same directory as your scene code.
Warning
The config file
must
be named
manim.cfg
. Currently, Manim
does not support config files with any other name.
The config file must start with the section header
[CLI]
. The
configuration options under this header have the same name as the CLI flags
and serve the same purpose. Take, for example, the following config file.
[CLI]
# my config file
output_file
=
myscene
save_as_gif
=
True
background_color
=
WHITE
Config files are parsed with the standard python library
configparser
. In
particular, they will ignore any line that starts with a pound symbol
#
.
Now, executing the following command
manim
-o
myscene
-i
-c
WHITE
<file.py>
SceneName
is equivalent to executing the following command, provided that
manim.cfg
is in the same directory as <file.py>,
manim
<file.py>
SceneName
Tip
The names of the configuration options admissible in config files are
exactly the same as the
long names
of the corresponding command-
line flags. For example, the
-c
and
--background_color
flags
are interchangeable, but the config file only accepts
background_color
as an admissible option.
Since config files are meant to replace CLI flags, all CLI flags can be set via
a config file. Moreover, any config option can be set via a config file,
whether or not it has an associated CLI flag. See the bottom of this document
for a list of all CLI flags and config options.
Manim will look for a
manim.cfg
config file in the same directory as the
file being rendered, and
not
in the directory of execution. For example,
manim
-o
myscene
-i
-c
WHITE
<path/to/file.py>
SceneName
will use the config file found in
path/to/file.py
, if any. It will
not
use the config file found in the current working directory, even if it exists.
In this way, the user may keep different config files for different scenes or
projects, and execute them with the right configuration from anywhere in the
system.
The file described here is called the
folder-wide
config file because it
affects all scene scripts found in the same folder.
The user config file
¶
As explained in the previous section, a
manim.cfg
config file only
affects the scene scripts in its same folder. However, the user may also
create a special config file that will apply to all scenes rendered by that
user. This is referred to as the
user-wide
config file, and it will apply
regardless of where Manim is executed from, and regardless of where the scene
script is stored.
The user-wide config file lives in a special folder, depending on the operating
system.
Windows:
UserDirectory
/AppData/Roaming/Manim/manim.cfg
MacOS:
UserDirectory
/.config/manim/manim.cfg
Linux:
UserDirectory
/.config/manim/manim.cfg
Here,
UserDirectory
is the user’s home folder.
Note
A user may have many
folder-wide
config files, one per folder,
but only one
user-wide
config file. Different users in the same
computer may each have their own user-wide config file.
Warning
Do not store scene scripts in the same folder as the user-wide
config file. In this case, the behavior is undefined.
Whenever you use Manim from anywhere in the system, Manim will look for a
user-wide config file and read its configuration.
Cascading config files
¶
What happens if you execute Manim and it finds both a folder-wide config file
and a user-wide config file? Manim will read both files, but if they are
incompatible,
the folder-wide file takes precedence
.
For example, take the following user-wide config file
# user-wide
[CLI]
output_file
=
myscene
save_as_gif
=
True
background_color
=
WHITE
and the following folder-wide file
# folder-wide
[CLI]
save_as_gif
=
False
Then, executing
manim
<file.py>
SceneName
will be equivalent to not
using any config files and executing
manim
-o
myscene
-c
WHITE
<file.py>
SceneName
Any command-line flags have precedence over any config file. For example,
using the previous two config files and executing
manim
-c
RED
<file.py>
SceneName
is equivalent to not using any config files and
executing
manim
-o
myscene
-c
RED
<file.py>
SceneName
There is also a
library-wide
config file that determines Manim’s default
behavior and applies to every user of the library. It has the least
precedence, so any config options in the user-wide and any folder-wide files
will override the library-wide file. This is referred to as the
cascading
config file system.
Warning
The user should not try to modify the library-wide file
.
Contributors should receive explicit confirmation from the core
developer team before modifying it.
Order of operations
¶
With so many different ways of configuring Manim, it can be difficult to know
when each config option is being set. In fact, this will depend on how Manim
is being used.
If Manim is imported from a module, then the configuration system will follow
these steps:
The library-wide config file is loaded.
The user-wide and folder-wide files are loaded if they exist.
All files found in the previous two steps are parsed in a single
ConfigParser
object, called
parser
. This is where
cascading
happens.
logging.Logger
is instantiated to create Manim’s global
logger
object. It is configured using the “logger” section of the parser,
i.e.
parser['logger']
.
ManimConfig
is instantiated to create the global
config
object.
The
parser
from step 3 is fed into the
config
from step 5 via
ManimConfig.digest_parser()
.
Both
logger
and
config
are exposed to the user.
If Manim is being invoked from the command line, all of the previous steps
happen, and are complemented by:
The CLI flags are parsed and fed into
config
via
digest_args()
.
If the
--config_file
flag was used, a new
ConfigParser
object
is created with the contents of the library-wide file, the user-wide file if
it exists, and the file passed via
--config_file
. In this case, the
folder-wide file, if it exists, is ignored.
The new parser is fed into
config
.
The rest of the CLI flags are processed.
To summarize, the order of precedence for configuration options, from lowest to
highest precedence is:
Library-wide config file,
user-wide config file, if it exists,
folder-wide config file, if it exists OR custom config file, if passed via
--config_file
,
other CLI flags, and
any programmatic changes made after the config system is set.
