Bases:
Magics
Create a configurable given a config config.
Parameters
:
config
(
Config
) – If this is empty, default values are used. If config is a
Config
instance, it will be used to configure the
instance.
parent
(
Configurable instance
,
optional
) – The parent Configurable instance of this object.
shell
(
InteractiveShell
)
Notes
Subclasses of Configurable must call the
__init__()
method of
Configurable
before
doing anything else and using
super()
:
class
MyConfigurable
(
Configurable
):
def
__init__
(
self
,
config
=
None
):
super
(
MyConfigurable
,
self
)
.
__init__
(
config
=
config
)
# Then any other code you need to finish initialization.
This ensures that instances will be configured properly.
Methods
add_additional_args
manim
Render Manim scenes contained in IPython cells.
Attributes

A trait whose value must be an instance of a specified class.
cross_validation_lock
A contextmanager for running a block with our cross validation lock set to True.

¶
Render Manim scenes contained in IPython cells.
Works as a line or cell magic.
Hint
This line and cell magic works best when used in a JupyterLab
environment: while all of the functionality is available for
classic Jupyter notebooks as well, it is possible that videos
sometimes don’t update on repeated execution of the same cell
if the scene name stays the same.
This problem does not occur when using JupyterLab.
Please refer to
https://jupyter.org/
for more information about JupyterLab
and Jupyter notebooks.
Usage in line mode:
%
manim
[
CLI
options
]
MyAwesomeScene
Usage in cell mode:
%%
manim
[
CLI
options
]
MyAwesomeScene
class
MyAweseomeScene
(
Scene
):
def
construct
(
self
):
...
Run
%manim
--help
and
%manim
render
--help
for possible command line interface options.
Note
The maximal width of the rendered videos that are displayed in the notebook can be
configured via the
media_width
configuration option. The default is set to
25vw
,
which is 25% of your current viewport width. To allow the output to become as large
as possible, set
config.media_width
=
"100%"
.
The
media_embed
option will embed the image/video output in the notebook. This is
generally undesirable as it makes the notebooks very large, but is required on some
platforms (notably Google’s CoLab, where it is automatically enabled unless suppressed
by
config.embed
=
False
) and needed in cases when the notebook (or converted HTML
file) will be moved relative to the video locations. Use-cases include building
documentation with Sphinx and JupyterBook. See also the
manim
directive
for
Sphinx
.
Examples
First make sure to put
import
manim
, or even
from
manim
import
*
in a cell and evaluate it. Then, a typical Jupyter notebook cell for Manim
could look as follows:
%%
manim
-
v
WARNING
--
disable_caching
-
qm
BannerExample
config
.
media_width
=
"75%"
config
.
media_embed
=
True
class
BannerExample
(
Scene
):
def
construct
(
self
):
self
.
camera
.
background_color
=
"#ece6e2"
banner_large
=
ManimBanner
(
dark_theme
=
False
)
.
scale
(
0.7
)
self
.
play
(
banner_large
.
create
())
self
.
play
(
banner_large
.
expand
())
Evaluating this cell will render and display the
BannerExample
scene defined in the body of the cell.
Note
In case you want to hide the red box containing the output progress bar, the
progress_bar
config
option should be set to
None
. This can also be done by passing
--progress_bar
None
as a
CLI flag.
