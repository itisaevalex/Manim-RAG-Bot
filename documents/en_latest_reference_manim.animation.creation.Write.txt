.
Examples
Example: ShowWrite
¶
from
manim
import
*
class
ShowWrite
(
Scene
):
def
construct
(
self
):
self
.
play
(
Write
(
Text
(
"Hello"
,
font_size
=
144
)))
class ShowWrite(Scene):
 def construct(self):
 self.play(Write(Text("Hello", font_size=144)))
Example: ShowWriteReversed
¶
from
manim
import
*
class
ShowWriteReversed
(
Scene
):
def
construct
(
self
):
self
.
play
(
Write
(
Text
(

,
remover
=
False
))
class ShowWriteReversed(Scene):
 def construct(self):
 self.play(Write(Text("Hello", font_size=144), reverse=True, remover=False))

Check that creating empty
Write
animations works:
>>>

Text
>>>
Write
(

''
))
Write(Text(''))
