Enhancements
¶
#1728
: Improved positioning and size of the OpenGL window; added some configuration options
#1733
: Let OpenGLMobject.copy return a deep copy by default
#1735
: Metaclass compatibility for
coordinate_system.py
,
Code
and
ParametricSurface
#1585
: OpenGL compatibility via metaclass for
Matrix
,
DecimalNumber
,
Variable
#1713
: Exit the command line interface gracefully if no scene was chosen
#1652
: Refactored
Mobject
and
Scene
to no longer inherit from the abstract base class
Container
Moved tests in
test_container.py
for
Container
that test
Scene
and
Mobject
to their own files.
Corrected various instances of incorrectly passed keyword arguments, or unused keyword arguments.
#1693
: Made the default arrowhead size for
Arrow3D
smaller
#1678
: Allow some rate functions to assume values outside of [0, 1]; introduce clamping decorators
Fixed animations so that certain rate functions (
running_start
,
wiggle
,
ease_in_back
,
ease_out_back
,
ease_in_out_back
,
ease_in_elastic
,
ease_out_elastic
, and
ease_out_elastic
) can go outside the range from 0 to 1.
Fixed lag ratios so that they’re spaced out evenly within the time interval and the rate functions are applied to each animation individually, rather than having the rate function determine when the animation starts.
Fixed faulty code for
ease_in_out_expo
,
ease_in_bounce
,
ease_out_bounce
, and
ease_in_out_bounce
.
#1649
: Made video file names in Jupyter notebook more readable
#1667

#1608
: Color file paths in terminal; remove curly braces surrounding the file path in “Partial movie file written in…” messages
#1632
: OpenGL compatibility via metaclass:
Group
