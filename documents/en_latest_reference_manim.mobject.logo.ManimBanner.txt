¶
The creation animation for Manim’s logo.
Parameters
:
run_time
(
float
) – The run time of the animation.
Returns
:
An animation to be used in a
Scene.play()
call.
Return type
:
AnimationGroup
expand
(
run_time
=
1.5
,
direction
=
'center'
)
[source]
¶
An animation that expands Manim’s logo into its banner.
The returned animation transforms the banner from its initial
state (representing Manim’s logo with just the icons) to its
expanded state (showing the full name together with the icons).
See the class documentation for how to use this.
Note
Before calling this method, the text “anim” is not a
submobject of the banner object. After the expansion,
it is added as a submobject so subsequent animations
to the banner object apply to the text “anim” as well.
Parameters
:
run_time
(
float
) – The run time of the animation.
direction
– The direction in which the logo is expanded.
Returns
:
An animation to be used in a
Scene.play()
call.
Return type
:
