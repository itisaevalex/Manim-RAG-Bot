¶
Bases:
Animation
Plays a group or series of
Animation
.
Parameters
:
animations
(
Animation
|
Iterable
[
Animation
]
|
types.GeneratorType
[
Animation
]
) – Sequence of
Animation
objects to be played.
group
(
Group
|
VGroup
|
OpenGLGroup
|
OpenGLVGroup
) – A group of multiple
Mobject
.
run_time
(
float
|
None
) – The duration of the animation in seconds.
rate_func
(
Callable
[
[
float
]
,
float
]
) – The function defining the animation progress based on the relative
runtime (see
rate_functions
) .
lag_ratio
(
float
) –
Defines the delay after which the animation is applied to submobjects. A lag_ratio of
n.nn
means the next animation will play when
nnn%
of the current animation has played.
Defaults to 0.0, meaning that all animations will be played together.
This does not influence the total runtime of the animation. Instead the runtime
of individual animations is adjusted so that the complete animation has the defined
run time.
Methods
begin
Begin the animation.
build_animations_with_timings
Creates a list of triplets of the form (anim, start_time, end_time).
clean_up_from_scene
Clean up the
Scene
after finishing the animation.
finish
Finish the animation.
get_all_mobjects
Get all mobjects involved in the animation.
init_run_time
Calculates the run time of the animation, if different from
run_time
.
interpolate
Set the animation progress.
update_mobjects
Updates things like starting_mobject, and (for Transforms) target_mobject.

Return type

_setup_scene
(
scene
)
[source]
¶
Setup up the
Scene
before starting the animation.
This includes to
add()
the Animation’s
Mobject
if the animation is an introducer.
Parameters
:
scene
– The scene the animation should be cleaned up from.
Return type
:
None
begin
(
)
[source]
¶
Begin the animation.
This method is called right as an animation is being played. As much
initialization as possible, especially any mobject copying, should live in this
method.
Return type
:
None
build_animations_with_timings
(
)
[source]
¶
Creates a list of triplets of the form (anim, start_time, end_time).
Return type
:
None
clean_up_from_scene
(
scene
)
[source]
¶
Clean up the
Scene
after finishing the animation.
This includes to
remove()
the Animation’s
Mobject
if the animation is a remover.
Parameters
:
scene
(
Scene
) – The scene the animation should be cleaned up from.
Return type
:
None
finish
(
)
[source]
¶
Finish the animation.
This method gets called when the animation is over.
Return type
:
None
get_all_mobjects
(
)
[source]
¶
Get all mobjects involved in the animation.
Ordering must match the ordering of arguments to interpolate_submobject
Returns
:
The sequence of mobjects.
Return type
:
Sequence[
Mobject
]
init_run_time
(
run_time
)
[source]
¶
Calculates the run time of the animation, if different from
run_time
.
Parameters
:
run_time
– The duration of the animation in seconds.
Returns
:
The duration of the animation in seconds.
Return type
:
run_time
interpolate
(
alpha
)
[source]
¶
Set the animation progress.
This method gets called for every frame during an animation.
Parameters
:
alpha
(
float
) – The relative time to set the animation to, 0 meaning the start, 1 meaning
the end.
Return type
:
None
update_mobjects
(
dt
)
[source]
¶
Updates things like starting_mobject, and (for
Transforms) target_mobject. Note, since typically
(always?) self.mobject will have its updating
suspended during the animation, this will do
nothing to self.mobject.
Parameters
:
dt
(
float
)
Return type
:
None
