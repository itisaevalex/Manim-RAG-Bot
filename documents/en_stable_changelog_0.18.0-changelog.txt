Breaking changes
¶
#3020
: Rewrote Manim’s color system
This change removed the
colour
library as a dependency
of Manim and replaced the internal handling of colors with
the newly added
ManimColor
. This also adds hundreds
of new predefined colors, see
utils.color
for more
details.
This should only be a breaking change if you have interacted
directly with the
colour
module before. The general interface
has been kept stable.
Highlights
¶
#3299
: Added new
manim
checkhealth
CLI subcommand
This adds a new command line interface subcommand which can be used to check
whether a local installation of Manim has been configured correctly, and all
required (and optional) dependencies are available. To try it, run it via
manim
checkhealth
or
python
-m
manim
checkhealth
.
#3427
: New feature: rendered examples in documentation can now be run directly via binder
This adds a “Make interactive” button below the examples in our documentation
that establishes a connection to binder such that examples can be modified and
rerendered directly from your browser.
#3086
: Introduced a new module
typing
for type hints
This also adds various type hints to integral parts of the code base.
#3322
: Implemented auto-removal of auxiliary LaTeX files, enabled by default
This automatically removes auxiliary files creating during the compilation of
LaTeX documents like
.aux
or
.dvi
files. This behavior can be controlled
via the newly introduced
no_latex_cleanup
config key (
False
by default).
On the command line, the autoremoval can be disabled via the
--no_latex_cleanup
CLI flag.
#3395
: Added support for Python 3.12
New features
¶
#3361
: Added three new rate functions
This adds the rate functions
smoothstep()
,
smootherstep()
,
smoothererstep()
based on the SmoothStep sigmoid functions.
#3264
: Added new mobjects
LabeledLine
and
LabeledArrow
Enhancements
¶
#3190
: Made
CurvesAsSubmobjects
mobjects compatible with
input_to_graph_point()
#3226
: Avoid using a mobject as a default argument of
ArcBrace
#3366
: Added spacing between values and unit in
DecimalNumber
This adds the new keyword argument
unit_buff_per_font_unit
(default: 0, for
backwards compatibility). Setting it to some positive number creates additional
space between the numeric value and the displayed unit.
