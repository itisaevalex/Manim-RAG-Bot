add_partial_movie_file
(
hash_animation
)
[source]
¶
Adds a new partial movie file path to
scene.partial_movie_files
and current section from a hash.
This method will compute the path from the hash. In addition to that it adds the new animation to the current section.
Parameters
:
hash_animation
(
str
) – Hash of the animation.
Return type
:
None
begin_animation
(
allow_write
=
True
,
file_path
=
None
)
[source]
¶
Used internally by manim to stream the animation to FFMPEG for
displaying or writing to a file.
Parameters
:
allow_write
(
bool
) – Whether or not to write to a video file.
file_path
(
StrPath
|
None
)
Return type
:
Any
clean_cache
(
)

None
combine_to_section_videos
(
)
[source]
¶
Concatenate partial movie files for each section.
Return type
:
None
end_animation
(
allow_write
=
False
)
[source]
¶
Internally used by Manim to stop streaming to
FFMPEG gracefully.
Parameters
:
allow_write
(
bool
) – Whether or not to write to a video file.
Return type
:
None
init_output_directories
(
scene_name
)
[source]
¶
Initialise output directories.
Notes
The directories are read from
config
, for example
config['media_dir']
. If the target directories don’t already
exist, they will be created.
Parameters
:
scene_name
(
StrPath
)
Return type
:
None
write_frame

frame_or_renderer
,
num_frames
=
1
)
[source]
¶
Used internally by Manim to write a frame to
the FFMPEG input buffer.
Parameters
:
frame_or_renderer
(
PixelArray
|
OpenGLRenderer
) – Pixel array of the frame.
num_frames
(
int
) – The number of times to write frame.
Return type
:
None
