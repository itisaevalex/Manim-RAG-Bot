v0.2.0
¶
Date
:
January 1, 2021
The changes since Manim Community release v0.1.1 are listed below.
Breaking Changes
¶
Remove all CONFIG dictionaries and all calls to
digest_config
and allow
passing options directly to the constructor of the corresponding classes (
#783
).
Practically, this means that old constructions using
CONFIG
like:
class
SomeMobject
(
Thing
):
CONFIG
=
{
"my_awesome_property"
:
42
}
where corresponding objects were then instantiated as
my_mobject
=
SomeMobject()
should now be created simply using
my_mobject
=
SomeMobject(my_awesome_property=42)
.
Remove old syntax for animating mobject methods by passing the methods and arguments to
self.play
,
and use a new syntax featuring the
animate
property (
#881
).
For example: the old-style
play
call
self
.
play
(
my_square
.
shift
,
LEFT
)
should be replaced with the new following call using the
animate
property:
self
.
play
(
my_square
.
animate
.
shift
(
LEFT
))
