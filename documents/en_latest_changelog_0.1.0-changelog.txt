v0.1.0
¶
Date
:
October 21, 2020
This is the first release of manimce after forking from 3b1b/manim. As such,
developers have focused on cleaning up and refactoring the codebase while still
maintaining backwards compatibility wherever possible.
New Features
¶
Command line
¶
Output of ‘manim –help’ has been improved
Implement logging with the
rich
library and a
logger
object instead of plain ol’ prints
Added a flag
--dry_run
, which doesn’t write any media
Allow for running manim with
python3
-m
manim
Refactored Tex Template management. You can now use custom templates with command line args using
--tex_template
!
Re-add
--save_frames
flag, which will save each frame as a png
Re-introduce manim feature that allows you to type manim code in
stdin
if you pass a minus sign
(-)
as filename
Added the
--custom_folders
flag which yields a simpler output folder structure
Re-implement GIF export with the
-i
flag (using this flag outputs ONLY a .gif file, and no .mp4 file)
Added a
--verbose
flag
You can save the logs to a file by using
--log_to_file
Read
tex_template
from config file if not specified by
--tex_template
.
Add experimental javascript rendering with
--use_js_renderer
Add
-q/--quality
[k|p|h|m|l]
flag and removed
-m/-l
flags.
Removed
--sound
flag
Config system
¶
Implement a
manim.cfg
config file system, that consolidates the global configuration, the command line argument parsing, and some of the constants defined in
constants.py
Added utilities for manipulating Manim’s
.cfg
files.
Added a subcommand structure for easier use of utilities managing
.cfg
files
Also some variables have been moved from
constants.py
to the new config system:
FRAME_HEIGHT
to
config["frame_width"]
TOP
to
config["frame_height"]
/
2
*
UP
BOTTOM
to
config["frame_height"]
/
2
*
DOWN
LEFT_SIDE
to
config["frame_width"]
/
2
*
LEFT
RIGHT_SIDE
to
config["frame_width"]
/
2
*
RIGHT
self.camera.frame_rate
to
config["frame_rate"]
Mobjects, Scenes, and Animations
¶
Add customizable left and right bracket for
Matrix
mobject and
set_row_colors
method for matrix mobject
Add
AddTeXLetterByLetter
animation
Enhanced GraphScene
You can now add arrow tips to axes
extend axes a bit at the start and/or end
have invisible axes
highlight the area between two curves
ThreeDScene now supports 3dillusion_camera_rotation
Add
z_index
for manipulating depth of Objects on scene.
Add a
VDict
class: a
VDict
is to a
VGroup
what a
dict
is to a
list
Added Scene-caching feature. Now, if a partial movie file is unchanged in your code, it isn’t rendered again! [HIGHLY UNSTABLE We’re working on it ;)]
Most
get_
and
set_
methods have been removed in favor of instance attributes and properties
The
Container
class has been made into an AbstractBaseClass, i.e. in cannot be instantiated. Instead, use one of its children classes
The
TextMobject
and
TexMobject
objects have been deprecated, due to their confusing names, in favour of
Tex
and
MathTex
. You can still, however, continue to use
TextMobject
and
TexMobject
, albeit with Deprecation Warnings constantly reminding you to switch.
Add a
Variable
class for displaying text that continuously updates to reflect the value of a python variable.
The
Tex
and
MathTex
objects allow you to specify a custom TexTemplate using the
template
keyword argument.
VGroup
now supports printing the class names of contained mobjects and
VDict
supports printing the internal dict of mobjects
Add all the standard easing functions
Scene
now renders when
Scene.render()
is called rather than upon instantiation.
ValueTracker
now supports increment using the
+=
operator (in addition to the already existing
increment_value
method)
Add
PangoText
for rendering texts using Pango.

ArcBetweenPoints
Of interest to developers
¶

tool
