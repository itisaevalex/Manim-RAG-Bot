Bases:
GrowFromCenter
Introduce an
Mobject
spinning and growing it from its center.
Parameters
:
mobject
(
Mobject
) – The mobjects to be introduced.
angle
(
float
) – The amount of spinning before mobject reaches its full size. E.g. 2*PI means
that the object will do one full spin before being fully introduced.
point_color
(
str
) – Initial color of the mobject before growing to its full size. Leave empty to match mobject’s color.
