Bases:
GrowFromPoint
Introduce an
Mobject
by growing it from one of its bounding box edges.
Parameters
:
mobject
(
Mobject
) – The mobjects to be introduced.
edge
(
np.ndarray
) – The direction to seek bounding box edge of mobject.
point_color
(
str
) – Initial color of the mobject before growing to its full size. Leave empty to match mobject’s color.
