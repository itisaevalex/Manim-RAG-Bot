Highlights
¶
#2550
: New thematic guide: a deep dive into the internals of the library
This new
thematic guide
aims to be a comprehensive walkthrough
describing all the things that Manim does when you run it to produce a video.
#2732
: Improved overall structure of deployed documentation; added a dedicated
FAQ section
#2749
: Added
ChangeSpeed
, an animation wrapper that allows to smoothly change the speed at which an animation is played
The speed of any animation can be changed by wrapping the animation with
ChangeSpeed
and passing a dictionary as
speedinfo
whose keys are the relative animation run time stamps and whose values are the absolute speed factors; e.g.,
{0.5:
2,
0.75:
0.25}
smoothly speeds up the animation by a factor of 2 once it has been completed to 50%, and then it is smoothly slowed down to 1/4 of the default run speed after 75% of the animation are completed. The
run_time
of the animation will be adjusted to match the changed play speed.
It is also possible to add time-based updaters that respect the change in speed, use the auxiliary
ChangeSpeed.add_updater()
method to do so.
