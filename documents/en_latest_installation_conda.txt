Conda
¶
Required Dependencies
¶
There are several package managers that work with conda packages,
namely
conda
,
mamba
and
pixi
.
After installing your package manager, you can create a new environment and install
manim
inside by running
conda / mamba
# if you want to use mamba, just replace conda below with mamba
conda
create
-n
my-manim-environment
conda
activate
my-manim-environment
conda
install
-c
conda-forge
manim
pixi
pixi
init
pixi
add
manim
Since all dependencies (except LaTeX) are handled by conda, you don’t need to worry
about needing to install additional dependencies.
Optional Dependencies
¶
In order to make use of Manim’s interface to LaTeX to, for example, render
equations, LaTeX has to be installed as well. Note that this is an optional
dependency: if you don’t intend to use LaTeX, you don’t have to install it.
Recommendations on how to install LaTeX on different operating systems
can be found
in our local installation guide
.
