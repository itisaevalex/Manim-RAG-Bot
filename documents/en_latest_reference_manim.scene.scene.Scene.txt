Bases:
object
A Scene is the canvas of your animation.
The primary role of
Scene
is to provide the user with tools to manage
mobjects and animations. Generally speaking, a manim script consists of a class
that derives from
Scene
whose
Scene.construct()
method is overridden
by the user’s code.
Mobjects are displayed on screen by calling
Scene.add()
and removed from
screen by calling
Scene.remove()
. All mobjects currently on screen are kept
in
Scene.mobjects
. Animations are played by calling
Scene.play()
.
A
Scene
is rendered internally by calling
Scene.render()
. This in
turn calls
Scene.setup()
,
Scene.construct()
, and
Scene.tear_down()
, in that order.
It is not recommended to override the
__init__
method in user Scenes. For code
that should be ran before a Scene is rendered, use
Scene.setup()
instead.
Examples
Override the
Scene.construct()
method with your code.

)
add_updater
(
func
)
[source]
¶
Add an update function to the scene.
The scene updater functions are run every frame,
and they are the last type of updaters to run.
Warning
When using the Cairo renderer, scene updaters that
modify mobjects are not detected in the same way
that mobject updaters are. To be more concrete,
a mobject only modified via a scene updater will
not necessarily be added to the list of
moving
mobjects
and thus might not be updated every frame.
TL;DR: Use mobject updaters to update mobjects.
Parameters
:
func
(
Callable
[
[
float
]
,
None
]
) – The updater function. It takes a float, which is the
time difference since the last update (usually equal
to the frame rate).
Return type
:
None

¶
tl:wr
If your scene has a Group(), and you removed a mobject from the Group,
this dissolves the group and puts the rest of the mobjects directly
in self.mobjects or self.foreground_mobjects.
In cases where the scene contains a group, e.g. Group(m1, m2, m3), but one
of its submobjects is removed, e.g. scene.remove(m1), the list of mobjects
will be edited to contain other submobjects, but not m1, e.g. it will now
insert m2 and m3 to where the group once was.
Parameters
:
to_remove
(
Sequence
[
Mobject
]
) – The Mobject to remove.
mobject_list_name
(
str
) – The list of mobjects (“mobjects”, “foreground_mobjects” etc) to remove from.
extract_families

bool
) – Whether the mobject’s families should be recursively extracted.
Returns
:
The Scene mobject with restructured Mobjects.
Return type

update_self
(

)
[source]
¶
Run all scene updater functions.

wait
(
duration

)
[source]
¶
Plays a “no operation” animation.
Parameters
:
duration
(
float
) – The run time of the animation.
stop_condition
(
Callable
[
[
]
,
bool
]
|
None
) – A function without positional arguments that is evaluated every time
a frame is rendered. The animation only stops when the return value
of the function is truthy, or when the time specified in
duration
passes.
frozen_frame
(
bool
|
None
) – If True, updater functions are not evaluated, and the animation outputs
a frozen frame. If False, updater functions are called and frames
are rendered as usual. If None (the default), the scene tries to
determine whether or not the frame is frozen on its own.
