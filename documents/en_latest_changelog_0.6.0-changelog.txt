Breaking changes
¶
#1347
: Restructure vector_field module and add documentation
:class`~.VectorField` is renamed to
ArrowVectorField
and a new class
VectorField
is added as a superclass for
ArrowVectorField
and
StreamLines
.
AnimatedStreamLines
is removed. It’s functionality is moved to
StreamLines
. Added a lot of new options when working with vector fields.
ShowPassingFlashWithThinningStrokeWidth
was moved to the indication module.
#1161
: Upgrades to CoordinateSystem and graphing.
Breaking changes were introduced to
Axes
,
ThreeDAxes
,
NumberPlane
and
NumberLine
All the above now use lists to construct their ranges as opposed to explicitly defining these values.
x_range
has replaced
x_min
,
x_max
and defining the step is much easier with
x_step
–>
x_range
:
[x_min,
x_max,
x_step]
. There were also many upgrades to these classes which improve their functionality and appearance.
NumberLineOld
was introduced to continue support for
GraphScene
, although we are moving away from GraphScene and intend to deprecate it in a future release.
#1013
: Refactored the Command Line Interface to use Click instead of Argparse
This change breaks the CLI API to organize the structure of Manim Community’s commands, options, and arguments.
To be more in line with POSIX compliant CLI conventions, options for commands are given
BEFORE
their arguments.
In Argparse:
manim
basic.py
-p
-ql
With Click:
manim
-p
-ql
basic.py
Although this is primarily a refactor and most of the common options are still there, some options have been added/removed. Use the
manim
command’s
--help
option, or simply run the command without providing options/arguments to view the help page with the full list of subcommands/options/arguments.
Added a
--fps
/
--frame_rate
option which allows for custom fps that don’t have to be integer (i.e. 29.97, 23.98, etc.). Users no longer have to specify the FPS from within a config file. Additionally, the
--webgl_renderer_fps
option has been removed. Use
--fps
or
--frame_rate
instead.
Added a
--renderer
option which you can use to select your choice of renderer (e.g.
--renderer=opengl
). There are currently
THREE
renderers to choose from!
Removed the
--background_color
option. Reassigned the
--background_color
option’s shorthand
-c
to
--config_file
.
Removed the
--leave_progress_bars
option. Use
--progress_bars=leave
instead.
Removed the deprecated render quality flags, in particular:
-l
,
-m
,
-h
,
-k
.
Removed the
--sound
option. It lost support long ago with the removal of SoX.
Deprecated classes and functions
¶
#1431
: Fix CLI bugs
Fixed conflict with
-f
which was previously assigned to both
--show_in_file_browser
and
--format
by removing
-f
from
--format
. A warning is issued that
-f
will soon move to
--format
.
Added back in flags to render the files as gif/last frame. Deprecated them in favor of
--format
.
Fixed the broken
--output_file
/
-o
option.
Fixed an issue where the
-qh
quality option was interpreted as
-q
-h
, prompting the help page.
