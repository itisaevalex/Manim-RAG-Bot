#2404
: Add
SpiralIn
Animation
Make
ManimBanner
to use
SpiralIn
.
#2534
: Implement
OpenGLImageMobject
#2684
: Created a more accessible way to create Angles with line.py angle function -
Angle.from_three_points()
Enhancements
¶
#2062
: Reuse shader wrappers and shader data
#2642
: Migrated
file_ops.py
and
scene_file_writer.py
from os.path to Pathlib
In
file_ops.py
and
scene_file_writer.py
: Uses of str type file names have been mostly (see further information) converted to pathlib’s Path objects. Uses of
os.path
methods have been converted to equivalent pathlib methods.
#2655
: Fix
assert_is_mobject_method()
when using OpenGL
#2665
: Improved handling of attributes when using the
.animate
syntax
#2674
: Document and type
simple_functions.py
Add documentation for
simple_functions.py
.
Small additions with some extra clarity for these functions.
#2693
: Allow using
MovingCamera.auto_zoom()
without animation
Allows auto zooming camera without having to play an animation by passing an
animation=False
argument
Fixed bugs
¶
#2546
: Fixed a file logging bug and some maintenance
#2597
: Fix Bug in
Uncreate
with
rate_func
via introducing new parameter
reversed
to
Animation
Refractor the
Uncreate
. The new implementation uses a flag member
reversed
. Set it to
True
and its superclass handles the reverse.
Introduce a bool parameter
reversed
to
Animation
. It decides whether the animation needs to be played backwards. Default to be False.
Add conditional branches in
Animation.get_sub_alpha()
. If the parameter
reversed
is True, it would set
rate_func(t)
to
rate_func(1
-
t)
.
#2613
: Fixed bug in
Circle.point_at_angle()
when the angle is not in the interval
\([0, 2\pi]\)
#2634
: Fix background lines drawn twice in
NumberPlane
#2648
: Handle user-defined centers for Wiggle animation
#2658
: Fix arguments of overridden
set_style
for
BackgroundRectangle
Using
Write
animation on a
Text
object with
.add_background_rectangle()
applied no longer generates a
TypeError
.
#2668
: (Re)set background color of
OpenGLRenderer
when initializing scene
#2676
: Fixed propagation of custom attributes in animations for the OpenGL renderer
#2688
: Fixed two minor issues of
SpiralIn
and
ManimBanner
