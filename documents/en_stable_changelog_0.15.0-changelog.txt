simple_functions
Removed
fdiv
as in all cases where it was used, it was just doing the same thing as numpy array division.
Replaced old implementation of the choose function with scipy’s implementation
Use
lru_cache
(least recently used cache) for caching the choose function. Since it’s only used for beziers, only 2 choose k and 3 choose k will be used, hence a size of 10 should be enough.
Removed
clip_in_place
in favor of
np.clip
Removed one use of
clip_in_place
that wasn’t actually doing anything
#2439
: Removed twitter template from scripts
