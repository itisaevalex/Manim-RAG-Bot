Adding Documentation
¶
Building the documentation
¶
When you clone the Manim repository from GitHub, you can access the
docs/
folder which contains the necessary files to build the
documentation.
To build the docs locally, open a CLI, enter the
docs/
folder with the
cd
command and execute the following depending on your OS:
Windows:
./make.bat
html
macOS and Linux:
make
html
The first time you build the docs, the process will take several
minutes because it needs to generate all the
.rst
(reST:
reStructured Text) files from scratch by reading and parsing all the
Manim content. The process becomes much shorter the next time, as it
rebuilds only the parts which have changed.
Sphinx library and extensions
¶
Manim uses
Sphinx
for building the
docs. It also makes use of Sphinx extensions such as:
Autodoc:
imports Manim’s Python source code, extracts its docstrings and
generates documentation from them.
Autosummary:
a complement to Autodoc which adds a special directive
autosummary
,
used in Manim to automatically document classes, methods,
attributes, functions, module-level variables and exceptions.
Autosummary makes use of
Jinja templates
,
which Manim defines for autosummarizing classes and modules
inside
docs/source/_templates/
.
Graphviz extension for Sphinx:
embeds graphs generated by the
Graphviz
module, which must be installed in order to render the
inheritance diagrams in the
Reference Manual
.
Napoleon:
enables Sphinx to read Google style docstrings and, in
particular for Manim,
NumPy style docstrings
- see
Adding Docstrings
for more information.
Sphinx theme
¶
The theme used for this website is
Furo
.
Custom Sphinx directives
¶
Manim implements
custom directives
for use with Autodoc and Autosummary, which
are defined in
docbuild
:
autoaliasattr_directive
A directive for documenting type aliases and other module-level attributes.
autocolor_directive
A directive for documenting colors in Manim.
manim_directive
A directive for including Manim videos in a Sphinx document
