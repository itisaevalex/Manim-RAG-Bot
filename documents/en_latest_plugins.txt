Plugins
¶
Plugins are features that extend Manim’s core functionality. Since Manim is
extensible and not everything belongs in its core, we’ll go over how to
install, use, and create your own plugins.
Note
The standard naming convention for plugins is to prefix the plugin with
manim-
. This makes them easy for users to find on package
repositories such as PyPI.
Warning
The plugin feature is new and under active development. Expect updates
for the best practices on installing, using, and creating plugins; as
well as new subcommands/flags for
manim
plugins
Tip
See
https://plugins.manim.community/
for the list of plugins available.
Installing Plugins
¶
Plugins can be easily installed via the
pip
command:
pip
install
manim-*
After installing a plugin, you may use the
manim
plugins
command to list
your available plugins, see the following help output:
manim
plugins
-h
Usage:

Using Plugins in Projects
¶
For enabling a plugin
manim.cfg
or command line parameters should be used.
Important
The plugins should be module name of the plugin and not PyPi name.
Enabling plugins through
manim.cfg
[CLI]
plugins
=
manim_rubikscube
For specifying multiple plugins, comma-separated values must be used.
[CLI]
plugins
=
manim_rubikscube, manim_plugintemplate
Creating Plugins
¶
Plugins are intended to extend Manim’s core functionality. If you aren’t sure
whether a feature should be included in Manim’s core, feel free to ask over
on the
Discord server
. Visit
manim-plugintemplate
on PyPI.org which serves as an in-depth tutorial for creating plugins.
pip
install
manim-plugintemplate
The only requirement of manim plugins is that they specify an entry point
with the group,
"manim.plugins"
. This allows Manim to discover plugins
available in the user’s environment. Everything regarding the plugin’s
directory structure, build system, and naming are completely up to your
discretion as an author.
The standard way to specify an entry point (see
the Python packaging guide
for details) is to include the following in your
pyproject.toml
:
[project.entry-points.
"manim.plugins"
]
"name"
=
"object_reference"
Removed in version 0.18.1:
Plugins should be imported explicitly to be usable in user code. The plugin
system will probably be refactored in the future to provide a more structured
interface.
A note on Renderer Compatibility
¶
Depending on which renderer is currently active, custom mobjects
created in your plugin might want to behave differently as the
corresponding mobject base classes are (unfortunately) not fully
compatible.
The currently active renderer can be queried by checking the value
of
manim.config.renderer
. All possible renderer types are given
by
constants.RendererType
. The module
manim.mobject.utils
contains utility functions that return the base class for the currently
active renderer.
A simple form of renderer compatibility (by hot-swapping the class
inheritance chain) for Mobjects directly inheriting from
Mobject
or
VMobject
can be achieved by using the
mobject.opengl.opengl_compatibility.ConvertToOpenGL
metaclass.
