Breaking changes
¶
#1990
: Changed and improved the implementation of
CoordinateSystem.get_area()
to work without Riemann rectangles
This changes how
CoordinateSystem.get_area()
is implemented. To mimic the old behavior (tiny Riemann rectangles), use
CoordinateSystem.get_riemann_rectangles()
with a small value for
dx
.
#2095
: Changed angles for polar coordinates to use math convention
This PR switches the parameter names
phi
and
theta
in
cartesian_to_spherical()
and
spherical_to_cartesian()
to align with the
usual definition in mathematics
.
Highlights
¶
#2094
: Implemented
ImplicitFunction
and
CoordinateSystem.get_implicit_curve()
for plotting implicit curves
An
ImplicitFunction
that plots the points
\((x, y)\)
which satisfy some equation
\(f(x,y) = 0\)
.
#2075
: Implemented
Mobject.set_default()
, a mechanism for changing default values of keyword arguments
#1998
: Added support for Boolean Operations on VMobjects
This PR introduces boolean operations for
VMobject
; see details and examples at
Union
,
Difference
,
Intersection
and
Exclusion
.

New features
¶
