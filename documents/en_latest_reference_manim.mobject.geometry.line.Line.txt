Bases:
TipableVMobject
A straight or curved line segment between two points or mobjects.
Parameters
:
start
(
Point3DLike
|
Mobject
) – The starting point or Mobject of the line.
end
(
Point3DLike
|
Mobject
) – The ending point or Mobject of the line.
buff
(
float
) – The distance to shorten the line from both ends.
path_arc
(
float
) – If nonzero, the line will be curved into an arc with this angle (in radians).
kwargs
(
Any
) – Additional arguments to be passed to
TipableVMobject

(
Vector3D
|
None
) – The direction.

)
[source]
¶
Sets the points of the line based on its start and end points.
Unlike
put_start_and_end_on()
, this method respects
self.buff
and
Mobject bounding boxes.
Parameters
:
start
(
Point3DLike
|
Mobject
) – The start point or Mobject of the line.
end
(
Point3DLike
|
Mobject
) – The end point or Mobject of the line.
buff
(
float
) – The empty space between the start and end of the line, by default 0.
path_arc
(
float
) – The angle of a circle spanned by this arc, by default 0 which is a straight line.
Return type
:
None
