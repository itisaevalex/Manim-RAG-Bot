Manim Community Edition
¶
Animating technical concepts is traditionally pretty tedious since it can be
difficult to make the animations precise enough to convey them accurately.
Manim relies on Python’s simplicity to generate animations programmatically,
making it convenient to specify exactly how each one should run. Take a look
at the
Example Gallery
for some inspiration on how to
create beautiful images and videos with Manim.
First Steps
¶
Are you new to Manim and are looking for where to get started? Then you are
in the right place!
Note
Please be aware that there are different, incompatible versions of Manim available.
ManimCE was forked from 3b1b/manim, originally created and open-sourced by Grant Sanderson, creator of [3Blue1Brown](
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw
) educational math videos.
Check our
installation FAQ
to learn more!
The
Installation
section has the latest and
up-to-date installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
You can also find information on Manim’s docker images and (online)
notebook environments there.
Want to try the library before installing it? Take a look at our
interactive online playground at
https://try.manim.community
in the form
of a Jupyter notebook.
In our
Tutorials
section you will find a
collection of resources that will teach you how to use Manim. In particular,
the
Quickstart
tutorial teaches you Manim’s basics,
and in
Manim’s building blocks
the classes used to compose
your animations are described in more detail.
